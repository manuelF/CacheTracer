CacheTracer
===========

Intel PIN Simulator extensions to simulate different many level caches and different jump predictors. It is 
mainly a project to study different performance improvements employed in the microarchitecture of CPU's.


Usage
=====

The folder "simulators" has to be placed in an accesible place to the PIN compiler files. 

The scripts "./cachesim.sh" and "./jmpsim.sh" run the PIN simulator with the corresponding cache and jump predictors.

Example output can be found in "cache.out" and "jmp.out". It is in spanish so far, but it can be translanted easily.
